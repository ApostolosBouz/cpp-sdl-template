- No interaction with package managers (It just fetches dependencies), so it will initially take a while to download and configure everything.
### Requirements:

- Visual Studio Code with CMake extension or cmake cli knowledge.
### Licence:
- Whatever SDL, it's dependencies and all the accompanying libraries have.
